Executive Summary:
Our current health system is hampering the transfer of free health and medical knowledge for underprivileged patients. Our project is a Knowledge Transfer System for patients. Its purpose is to educate these patients about their disease keeping in mind the local population and the language they require to understand their illness. It is designed to make them feel at ease, provide a relief and better understanding during their illness. This system will provide functionalities, where patients will be educated about their diseases through videos in Urdu. These videos have been made with the help of licensed medical specialists. 

The patients will be able to add their prescription to get reminders, search about their medicines, download their prescriptions and search for medical terminologies to find out their meaning. Additionally, there will be personalized diet plan for every set of users according to their disease and an option to seek help.
